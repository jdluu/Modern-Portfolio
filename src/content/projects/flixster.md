problem: "A core skill for mobile developers is fetching data from a remote server, parsing the response, and displaying it in a user-friendly way. This project tackles the need for a practical exercise in working with REST APIs and presenting complex data in a mobile UI."
solution: "Flixster is an app that fetches a list of currently playing movies from The Movie Database API. It parses the JSON data and displays the movies in a scrollable list, showing their poster, title, and a brief overview. Tapping on a movie reveals a detailed view with more information and an embedded YouTube player for the trailer."

process:
  - "Set up the project and made an asynchronous GET request to The Movie Database API to retrieve movie data."
  - "Created a custom 'Movie' data model and parsed the incoming JSON response into a list of these objects."
  - "Built a RecyclerView to display the movie list and a detail screen with an embedded YouTube player for trailers."

impact:
  - "Integrated a third-party REST API to fetch and display dynamic data from the web."
  - "Constructed a master-detail user interface, allowing users to browse a list and tap to view specific item details."
  - "Implemented an embedded video player using the YouTube Android Player API to play movie trailers."

reflection:
  - "Learned to handle asynchronous network requests to keep the application's UI responsive while fetching data."
  - "Practiced parsing complex JSON data and mapping it to custom Java objects for use within the app."
  - "Gained familiarity with using third-party libraries like Glide to efficiently load and cache images from a URL."
