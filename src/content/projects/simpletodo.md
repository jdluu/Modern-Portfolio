problem: "For those beginning their journey in Android development, it's essential to work on projects that teach the fundamentals of building an interactive application. A common challenge is understanding how to manage a list of data, handle user input, and save that data so it isn't lost when the app closes."

solution: "SimpleTodo is a classic introductory project that addresses these challenges directly. It provides a straightforward user interface for managing a list of tasks. The application demonstrates how to add items, handle user taps for removal and editing, and persist the to-do list locally on the device's storage."

process: "Designed a user interface with an input field, a button to add items, and a RecyclerView to display the to-do list. Implemented the core logic to add new items to the list and to remove items by long-pressing on them. Integrated local data persistence to save and load tasks, and built a separate edit screen to update items."

impact: "Built a functional to-do list application with features for adding, editing, and removing tasks. Used a RecyclerView to display and manage a dynamic list of data within the user interface. Implemented local data persistence to save and retrieve the task list from the device's storage."

reflection: "Learned about the Android Activity lifecycle and basic UI design principles. Practiced managing user interactions like clicks and long-presses to trigger different application logic. Understood how to navigate between different screens (Activities) and pass data between them."
