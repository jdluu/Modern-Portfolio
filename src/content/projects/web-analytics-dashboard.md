problem: "Web developers often misinterpret analytics data, leading to poor decisions based on inaccurate metrics. For instance, a high bounce rate on a single-page application might be incorrectly seen as poor performance when it's expected behavior."

solution: "This project provides a custom web analytics dashboard to accurately collect, interpret, and analyze user behavior. It enables a shift from assumption-based development to an evidence-based approach, leading to better decisions and results."

process: "Started by defining project requirements and identifying the key data points for collection and analysis. Designed the database schema, created the MySQL database, and developed the REST API endpoints with Express.js. Built the front-end dashboard, using ZingChart and ZingGrid to create interactive charts and tables for data visualization."

impact: "Designed scalable full-stack software solutions, covering both front-end and back-end development processes. Developed and managed a well-functioning MySQL database and a secure Node.js application. Implemented critical security features, including user authentication, authorization, and data protection measures."

reflection: "Gained experience in an open-ended project that required making independent implementation decisions to meet feature requirements. Learned to effectively justify technical decisions and weigh the tradeoffs between modern trends and older, more reliable technologies."
