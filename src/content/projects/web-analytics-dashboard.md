problem: "Web developers often misinterpret analytics data, leading to poor decisions based on inaccurate metrics. For instance, a high bounce rate on a single-page application might be incorrectly seen as poor performance when it's expected behavior."
solution: "This project provides a custom web analytics dashboard to accurately collect, interpret, and analyze user behavior. It enables a shift from assumption-based development to an evidence-based approach, leading to better decisions and results."

process:
  - "Started by defining project requirements and identifying the key data points for collection and analysis."
  - "Designed the database schema, created the MySQL database, and developed the REST API endpoints with Express.js."
  - "Built the front-end dashboard, using ZingChart and ZingGrid to create interactive charts and tables for data visualization."

impact:
  - "Designed scalable full-stack software solutions, covering both front-end and back-end development processes."
  - "Developed and managed a well-functioning MySQL database and a secure Node.js application."
  - "Implemented critical security features, including user authentication, authorization, and data protection measures."

reflection:
  - "Gained experience in an open-ended project that required making independent implementation decisions to meet feature requirements."
  - "Learned to effectively justify technical decisions and weigh the tradeoffs between modern trends and older, more reliable technologies."
