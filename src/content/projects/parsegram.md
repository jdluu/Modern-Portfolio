problem: "For students learning Android development, there's a need for practical projects that cover fundamental concepts like user authentication, interacting with a backend service, capturing media, and displaying data in a list."
solution: "Parsegram was created as a hands-on project to build an Instagram clone. It demonstrates how to implement user sign-up and login, post creation with images taken from the camera, and an infinite-scrolling feed of posts from a backend-as-a-service platform."

process:
  - "Set up the project with dependencies and implemented user authentication using the Parse backend."
  - "Developed the core photo-sharing feature, including camera integration for image capture and a screen for adding captions."
  - "Built the main feed with a RecyclerView to display all posts, adding pull-to-refresh and infinite scrolling."

impact:
  - "Built a functional photo-sharing application with user authentication, photo posting, and a timeline feed."
  - "Utilized a BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service) platform to handle backend logic and database management."
  - "Worked with Android components like RecyclerViews and implicit intents for camera access."

reflection:
  - "Learned how to connect an Android front-end application to a cloud backend service."
  - "Understood the importance of handling asynchronous network calls to maintain a responsive user interface."
  - "Practiced using third-party libraries like Glide for efficient image loading and caching from a URL."
