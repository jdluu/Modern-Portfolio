  - "Applied key object-oriented design principles and the MVC pattern to ensure the code was modular, maintainable, and scalable."
  - "Developed a robust testing suite using JUnit, Robolectric, and Espresso, automated with GitHub Actions for continuous integration."

impact:
  - "Built a comprehensive, automated testing pipeline with unit, integration, and UI tests to ensure app quality."
  - "Defined clear project scope and requirements by creating detailed user stories and BDD scenarios."
  - "Effectively managed the project backlog and tracked progress using ZenHub and GitHub Issues to keep the team aligned."

reflection:
  - "Gained invaluable experience in Agile software development, from planning iterations to collaborating effectively in a cross-functional team."
  - "Developed strong project management skills and technical familiarity with continuous integration and Android testing frameworks."
