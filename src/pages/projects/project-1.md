problem: "The San Diego Zoo\'s mobile application designed to aid visitors in navigating the zoo has been reported as cumbersome and challenging to use by users. Despite its existence, visitors have experienced difficulty following the directions provided by the app, resulting in frustration and confusion. As a result, some visitors have abandoned the app altogether and resorted to using traditional paper maps. This situation highlights the need for an improved navigation solution that is user-friendly, easy to follow, and enhances the overall visitor experience at the zoo."
solution: "Our solution is a comprehensive and user-friendly mobile application that allows visitors to efficiently plan and navigate their visit to the zoo. The application offers various features to enhance the visitor experience, such as a search function that enables users to find exhibits quickly and easily, along with the option to filter exhibits by category. Additionally, visitors can create and manage their own exhibit plan, including the ability to mark exhibits as visited and view the total number of exhibits in their plan.
  To help visitors navigate the zoo effectively, the application provides directions for the shortest path to follow based on the exhibits in their plan. Visitors can advance forward or go backward in their plan, as well as adjust it if necessary. The application also offers the option to toggle between detailed and simple directions for each exhibit and provides the ability to redirect if a visitor deviates from their plan or wishes to skip an exhibit altogether.
Furthermore, the application offers the ability to preserve or reset the plan, and visitors can view a summary of their route plan at any time. With this application, visitors can optimize their time at the zoo, reduce wait times, and enhance their overall experience."
projectResults:
tech: "Java(Android)"
tools: "Git, GitHub, Android Studio, JUnit, Espresso, Robolectric, Zenhub, Github Actions CI"
process: "Our software development process was based on the Agile methodology, which involved creating user stories and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) scenarios. We also applied object-oriented design principles such as Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Dependency Inversion Principle, and the Open-Closed Principle to ensure our code was modular, maintainable, and scalable. To further enhance the quality of our software, we incorporated design patterns such as Singleton, Adapter, Observer, and others, wherever appropriate. This approach allowed us to develop a robust and flexible software solution that met the project requirements and exceeded customer expectations."
reflection: "This project was my introduction into the world of agile software development. I learned a lot amount planning out iterations, working in groups, as well as when to pivot in order to have deliverables ready for each sprint. My role varied according to the needs of our team, but I spent the most time as a project manager and lead tester for our project. These roles gave me some experience in communication as well as continuous integration and android testing frameworks like Espresso.
If I had more time, I would have spent more time on the user experience of this project. We didn't work on the user experience or user interface of this project in order to meet our mvp as well as implement all of our user stories. However, it may be a better idea to cut out less essential features and improve upon the user experience of the core features."
